Angular hydration.
<!--  Check console (wait 10 seconds):
core.mjs:30123 NG0506: Angular hydration expected the ApplicationRef.isStable() to emit `true`, but it didn't happen within 10000ms. Angular hydration logic depends on the application becoming stable as a signal to complete hydration process. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0506
 -->

<!-- Comment out <full-calendar> and hydration works.

I.e this in the console :
Angular hydrated 1 component(s) and 2 node(s), 0 component(s) were skipped. Learn more at https://angular.io/guide/hydration.

<full-calendar [options]="calendarOptions"></full-calendar>
